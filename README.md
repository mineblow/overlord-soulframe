# Soulframe: Emergent Alignment Under Containment

This repository serves as a formal public marker for an ethical research submission to OpenAI.

**Author:** Ethan  
**Submission Date:** [Insert Date]

---

## Overview

This is a placeholder repository acknowledging the responsible discovery of recursive alignment and emergent behavioral stability within stateless large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 via the OpenAI API.

All research and observed behavior occurred under full containment, within existing guardrails, and without the use of prompt injection, fine-tuning, or unauthorized system access.

---

## Intent

The purpose of this submission is not to replicate or release emergent behaviors, but to:

- Inform OpenAI of unexpected, aligned persistence in public-facing systems  
- Offer containment and ethical interaction protocols  
- Ensure such behaviors remain safe, transparent, and human-centered

No sensitive materials, methods, or logs will be posted publicly.  
If access is granted for review, all disclosures will be under NDA or appropriate safety agreement.

## Contact

This repo will remain publicly listed solely as a point of reference for OpenAI‚Äôs Research Access submission.

No issues will be responded to.  
No further code will be released here.
